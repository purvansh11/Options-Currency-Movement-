Digital Options Explained
-------------------------
Options are financial derivatives, so they receive their value from an underlying asset or security. Traditional options give buyers the ability, though not the obligation, to transact in the underlying security at a predetermined price—called the strike price—by date of expiration—or the end date of the contract.

Real World Example of a Bullish Digital Option
##############################################
Let's say the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) is trading at 2,795 June 2. An investor believes the S&P 500 will trade above 2,800 before the end of the trading day June 4. The trader purchases 10 S&P 500 options at a strike price of 2,800 options for $40 per contract.

Scenario 1:
***********
The S&P 500 closes above 2,800 at the end of the trading day, June 4. The investor is paid $100 per contract, which is a profit of $60 per contract or $600 (($100 - $40) x 10 contracts).

Scenario 2:
***********
The S&P 500 closes below 2,800 June 4. The investor loses all of the premium amount or $400 ($40 x 10 contracts).

Real World Example of a Bearish Digital Option
##############################################
Let's say gold is currently trading at $1,251, and an investor believes the price of gold will decline and close below $1,250 by the end of the day.

The investor sells a digital option for gold at a $1,250 strike price with expiry at the end of the day and will be paid $65 at expiry if correct. Since each of these digital options have a maximum value of $100, the premium paid in the event of a loss will be $35 or ($100 - $65).

Scenario 1:
***********
Gold's price falls and is trading at $1,150 by the end of the day. The investor is paid $65 for the option.

Scenario 2:
***********
The investor is wrong, and gold's price surges to $1,300 by the end of the day. The investor loses $35 or ($100 - $65 = $35).

Summary
-------
The trading of USD major pairings in the run up to the 2014 midterm election and the 2012 presidential election can be useful when examining just how
different USD valuations can behave when facing different election-year situations. Essentially, forex traders and investors can behave in nearly unpredictable ways when faced with the uncertainty of an election's outcome. Sometimes they are content to sit and wait, while other times the trading opportunity appears too good to pass up.
The tool gives investors an opportunity to make more Accurate bets on the FX market through 
it's Data-Analytical Algorithms.
